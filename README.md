# Emission Model SWDS
This little project is supposed to help you evaluate potential methane emissions from solid waste disposal sites according to the model used in the [CDM UNFCCC](https://cdm.unfccc.int/methodologies/PAmethodologies/tools/am-tool-04-v6.0.1.pdf/history_view). Complete the tasks a) and b) given in the notebook to obtain the ready to use tool.

There are some nice illustrations in here, like heatmaps and stackplots, so I hope you have fun! I also put some comments in the code and a short explanation above each cell, so that the code can be better understood and modified. You can download the jupyter notebook and work with that, or use the [mybinder environment](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/lukashpe/-Emission-Model-SWDS_student/main?labpath=Emission%20Model%20SWDS_student.ipynb) without having to install all the python stuff.

Thanks to Allen Downey, whose book [Modeling and Simulation in Python](https://greenteapress.com/wp/modsimpy/) helped me a lot in the building process. I also used his [ModSim library](https://pypi.org/project/modsimpy/) in the project. Thanks also to Jan.
